This project is an end-to-end Multilanguage Invoice Extraction application built using Google Gemini Vision (Gemini 2.5 Flash) and Streamlit.

The application allows users to upload invoice images in different languages and interact with them using natural language prompts. By leveraging a multimodal AI model, the system can analyze invoice images, understand textual and visual content, and answer user questions accurately.

Key capabilities include:

Invoice image understanding using a vision-enabled LLM

Support for multilingual invoices

Dynamic question answering based on uploaded invoice content

Secure API key management using environment variables

User-friendly Streamlit interface for real-time interaction

This project is ideal for AI engineering portfolios, document intelligence use cases, and enterprise automation prototypes, demonstrating practical implementation of multimodal LLMs for real-world financial documents.
